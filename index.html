                <button class="school-content-title collapsible">Disease Surveillance</button>
                <div class="school-content-description">I took a class called distributed systems where we used AWS to run a program on a bunch of EC2 instances. We had a script that would start each one and do a simulation of disease outbreaks based on a preset configuration. There were 3 unique programs set up on the EC2 instances. One would compile information about each of the outbreaks and forward them on to another that would sort the results and report them to the final program that would gather the ‘reports’ and determine actions to take for their specific disease. They would each communicate to each other to make sure the system as a whole was up to date using a pub sub architecture(ZeroMQ).</div>
                <button class="school-content-title collapsible">Distributed Calculation of String Pairs</button>
                <div class="school-content-description">In my distributed systems class we created a system that could calculate edit distances of a huge list string pairs. This was accomplished using Amazon EC2 instances and S3 buckets. There would be a 'manager' elected amongst the EC2 instances, then the rest would be assigned tasks, moving their tasks into the S3 buckets until all tasks were done and then communicated to the manager that the work was done. The manager could then safely shut everything down.</div>
                <button class="school-content-title collapsible">Game Development Course</button>
                <div class="school-content-description">I took a game development course that was to be all done in Javascript. We programmed games like Snake, a custom Maze running game, Asteroids, and Frogger. Here's a link to my <a href="https://chaselundell.github.io/maze-game/maze-game.html">maze game</a>.</div>
                <button class="school-content-title collapsible">Fault Tolerant Software</button>
                <div class="school-content-description">
                    <p>For a security course we had to write a program that could withstand being killed every second (or less) and still be able to count to 100 (in 100 seconds) and save the results. To accomplish this IO used a UDP multicast system to communicate between a bunch of nodes about what the current status was and keep the program running even if parts of the system were killed.</p>
                    <!-- <p>We had a similar assignment where we had to program a system where a man in the middle would corrupt bits and drop messages between two communicating clients.</p> -->
                    <p>Our final assignment for that course was to create a program that would save chunks of a file at a time, successfully, even if some chunks became corrupted as the file is saving by a simulated corruption system. This was accomplished by saving it 3 times and having the threads to a vote as you read it back byte by byte to decide if it was correctly saved.</p>
